    "# The game consists of one cave with 20 rooms , one wumpus , two bats and two pits , you can either shoot and kill the wumpus\n",
    "#or if you move into a room where he is , he might eat you and loose the game . When you shoot at bats you kill them and move \n",

    "#you are randomly allocated a room , from there you have three options to shoot ,to move or quit . If you choose to quit\n",
    "#you loose the game ther it self. You can choose to shoot as well but remeber you have 5 arrows in your basket and you need to \n",
    "#use them wisely to kill wampus . \n",

    "#\"you hear a rustling\" means that there is a bat nearby\n",
    "#\"you feel a cold wind blowing from a nearby cavern\" means theres an empty pit in the room\n",
